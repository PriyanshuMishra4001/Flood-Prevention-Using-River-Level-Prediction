# Flood Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and dataset for the flood prediction project. The project aims to predict the river level using various machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **Codes**: Contains all the code related to the project. Each file in this folder is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
2. **Dataset**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Instructions

### Running the Code

#### Using Google Colab
If you are using Google Colab, you do not need to install any additional libraries. Just open the .ipynb files in Google Colab, import the necessary libraries, and run the cells.

#### Using a Local System
If you are running the code on your local system, you need to install the required libraries. Below is a list of all the necessary imports. You can install these libraries using pip:

       pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib

## Dataset Path
The dataset path is set to the current configuration in the code. If you change the location of the dataset, you need to update the dataset path in the code accordingly.
